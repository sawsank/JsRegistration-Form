# Registration-Form
# Created JavaScript functions (one for each input field whose value is to validate) which check whether a value submitted by user passes the validation.

# All those functions are called from another function.

# It sets the focus to the input field until the user supplies a valid value.

# When the user does so, they may proceed and can supply value to the next available field.

# The later JavaScript function created is called on the onsubmit event of the form.!

# Flowchart for flow of Js functions work
